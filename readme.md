I’m exploring the idea of using gamification to make the musical machine learning algorithms more understandable and fun. The first project is [Sornting](https://vibertthio.com/sornting/). "RUNN" is the 2nd one.

Basically, it is "run" (side-scrolling game) + "RNN". The user can play with the generated output without any prior knowledge about musical machine learning. Everyone can just play the game and enjoy the generated music. Also, they can keep the good vibe (the background beat) by controlling their avatar, or not. All the levels are generated realtime with a MusicRNN model.
